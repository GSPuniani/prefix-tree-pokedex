## About

This project visually showcases the genealogy of Pokemon using Prefix Trees (a.k.a. Tries). 

The accompanying Medium blog post for this project is available [here](). This blog post explains the concept of prefix trees and explains the purpose of this project. Essentially, we use the PyDot graph visualization library to display prefix trees consisting of Pokémon names. Since many Pokémon that are evolutionary variants of each other usually begin with the same few letters, we display these names as prefix trees to show related evolutionary states of some Pokémon.
